# just fucking put this shit on an ubuntu or localhost or really it doesn't fucking matter so just fart


This script can be very dynamic and customizable but why would you want to change what I just fucking wrote you dickhead. 



# Install requirements - put this shit in ur server prompt
1. 
    ```
    pip3 install notify-py
    pip3 install schedule
    pip3 install pycoingecko
    ```

Or i put a fuckinnnn requirements doc in there for u lazy shmucks 
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

2. After installing all that googoo gaga shit, run this biatch
```
python3 Main.py
```
set up ur notifications on ur shit also or it wont work -.-

# Usage
1. `python3 main.py`.This will run the script and give u that btc price

2. use `python3 Main.py --help` to see all the commands that work and then the others that dont work

2 . `python3 Main.py -t 2 `. This will run- ...  actually... u know what, just type the fucking help command in the console and figure it out once you fork it
